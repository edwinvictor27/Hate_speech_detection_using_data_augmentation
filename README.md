# Improving Hate Speech Detection with Data Augmentation Techniques

## Objective

This Project investigates how various data augmentation techniques can improve the performance of hate speech detection of nlp models

## Motivation

Hate speech detection models often struggle with limited or imbalanced datasets By employing augmentation we aim to
- Enhance model performance
- Improve performance on minority classes
- Provide a robust pipeline for hate speech detection

## Features
- **Data Augmentation Techniques**:
 - Synonym Replacement: Replace words with their synonyms from a pre-defined thesaurus
 - Back Translation : Translate text into another language and back to the original
 - Contextual Word Embeddings : Mask words and predict replacements using models like BERT 
 
- **Hate Speech Detection Pipeline**:
 - Preprocessing and text cleaning
 - Augmenting the data using pre-trained transformer models
 - Model training and evaluation with augmented datasets 
 - Performance evaluation using standard metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## Dataset
 This project utilizes publically available dataset from kaggle
 1) Kaggle Hate Speech detection
